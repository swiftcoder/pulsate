## A Stripped-Down Web Dev Boilerplate
### (For Unserved, WebPack free, static stuff)

## Features:

- a babelified, watchified, live-reloaded ES6 / module-based workflow 
- Bootstrap. C'mon, you know you want it.
- That's it. The idea is to keep fluff to a minimum.

## Installation: 

- clone
- npm install
- "npm start" launches two scripts: [watchify](https://github.com/substack/watchify) and [browser-sync](https://github.com/BrowserSync/browser-sync).

### Now go make things.
